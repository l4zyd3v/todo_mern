## Todo-card creation

#### As a user, I want to swipe up on the main screen, to create a new todo-card. I should see some subtle animation appear as I swipe - UX. When I have swiped up to a certain threshold, I want to see a modal where I can type the context of the new todo-card. When done typing, I want to swipe (up?) again, see the modal swipe away, and then a new todo-card animates in and appear on thre top of the others todo.

##### Acceptance Criteria

- ##### Swiping right or left on a todo-card initiates a delete action.

## Todo-card deletion

#### As a user, I want to be able to delete a todo-card by swiping right or back. When I swipe I see a trashcan appear behind from where the todo-card has been swiped away - When the todo-card has reached a certain set of pixel/rems the trashcan should shake a little bit and a text or something should appear, so the user can tell That a destructive behavior is about to be executed. When the swipe has reached it threshold, the todo-card will slide swiftly away.
